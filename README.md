# INSARAG USAR exercise sites dataset

This repository is maintained by OCHA’s Brand and Design Unit (BDU) to support the INSARAG team with an up-to-date dataset of global USAR exercise sites.

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically syncs the master Google Sheet into the `usar_sites.csv` file. This CSV is served directly to Datawrapper, ensuring the INSARAG map always reflects the latest updates entered by the team.

## Purpose
Provide a clean and continuously updated data source for the INSARAG USAR exercise sites map and other related visualization products.

## Data visualization
The Datawrapper map using this dataset is available here:

## Data source
The dataset is synced from a Google Sheet using a scheduled GitHub Action.
