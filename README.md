# insarag_exercises_datawrapper_BDU
Maintained by Design Unit (BDU) to support the INSARAG team with an up-to-date dataset of global USAR exercise sites. The repository automatically syncs a Google Sheet into a clean CSV format for use in Datawrapper and other visualization tools. This ensures the INSARAG web map remains current as new training locations are added or updated.
